KCCA-ReId
========

We provided the implementation of the paper Giuseppe Lisanti , Iacopo Masi , Alberto Del Bimbo, "Matching People across Camera Views using Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis”, Eighth ACM/IEEE International Conference on Distributed Smart Cameras, 2014.

##Requirements 
You need the following software to run the code:

1. MATLAB (Windows, Unix version is the same)
2. [Hardoon KCCA code package.](http://www.davidroihardoon.com/Professional/Code_files/kcca_package.tar.gz) (4.3 KB)
3. [Descriptors computed as described in the paper for the VIPeR and PRID dataset.](http://www.micc.unifi.it/lisanti/downloads/kccareid_data.zip) (229 MB)

## Citation
